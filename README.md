# DatapassWidget

This app allows all T-Mobile (probably only in Germany) users to get information about their current used data volume. Those values can be read from http://datapass.de.

With this app (which is no app, only a provider for a widget and a quick settings tile) you can:
- place a widget on your homescreen, whch always shows your current used volume for this month/period. From time to time it updates the data itself or by triggering manually by touching the widget.
- drag a so-called quick settings tile in your quick settings area, which also shows your current used volume for this month/period as percentage (only available on Android N). There is no automatic update; to update the tile, you have to click on it.

##Future Work
Also read data for other Network operators such as Vodafone or O2.
