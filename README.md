# DatapassWidget

This app allows all T-Mobile (probably only in Germany) users to get information about their current used data volume. Those values can be read from http://datapass.de. 

With this app (which is no app, only a widget) you can place a widget on your homescreen, whch always shows you your current used volume for this month/period. From time to time it updates the data itself or by triggering manually by touching the widget.

##Future Work
Also read data for other Network operators such as Vodafone or O2.
